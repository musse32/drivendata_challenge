# Use Machine Learning to Predict Faulty Water Pumps
Predict Faulty Water Pumps in Rural Tanzania



Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, 
we predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, 
and which don't work at all. This is an intermediate-level practice competition hosted by DrivenData.
We'll predict one of these three classes based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating,
when it was installed, and how it is managed. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance
operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.
